# LaunchDarkly demo
The goal of this app is to demonstrate seamless feature releases and instant remediation/rollback of impacting changes using LaunchDarkly feature flags. By the end of this project, you'll also understand how to define specific audiences for your feautre release, giving you the ability to target specific individuals for testing purposes or groups of users based on rulesets. You can read more about instant feature flag updates in [this blog post](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/how-near-instant-feature-flag-updates-ensure-your-app/), or learn how to implement your own feature flags in [this Getting Started guide](https://app.launchdarkly.com/projects/default/get-started?env=test&selected-env=test).

# How to get started with this app
1. Clone this project onto your local workstation. In a command line/terminal session:
   * Use `mkdir lddemo` to create a new directory named "lddemo" for this project
   * Use `cd lddemo` to move into your new directory
   * Use `git clone https://github.com/joderita/launchdarkly.git .` to clone this repository into your new directory
2. Get an API key from openweathermap.org.
   * Create an account using your email address
   * Verify your email address (be sure to check your Spam folder!)
   * Once validated, navigate to My API Keys under your profile name

   * Copy your Default API key
   * Create a `.env` file in your `lddemo` directory and add `WEATHER_API_KEY=<paste your API key here>`, replacing `<paste your API key here>` with the API key value from openweathermap.org
      


Create a LaunchDarkly account:
* grab client API key, save it in .env as "LD_API_KEY"
* create a new feature flag named "wind_speed"

In a terminal session, create .venv file
Launch virtual environment
Install Python, Flask, JavaScript?
python server.py to start app
Open browser to localhost:8000
Enter a city
Toggle feature flag, watch the magic happen
